# Nyx: Balance-less GTNH Experience

![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/GTNH_Version-2.7.3-blue)

English | [中文](README-ZH.md)

Currently WIP.

A random modification of the GT:NH mod-pack, initially inspired by TST (GTCM) in 2023,
aiming to create something more strange and overpowered things for personal enjoyment.
Lost interest in NH after reaching the Stargate in version 2.5.0.
After a year of gap, I rebuilt this mod using Kotlin.

Technical skills and balances are out of mind, as long as I enjoy playing with it.

## Current Features

Features may need to be enabled in the `nyx.cfg` config file.

- Added wireless lasers for IV~UMV, and easy recipes for all wireless energy. Enable in config `RECIPE_EASY_WIRELESS`

### Note: About ID Conflicts

I don't know how other self-made mods take MTE IDs, the only thing I can do is to give a config file used
to change ID offset of this mod. If you have ID conflicts, please change the offset in `config/nyx.cfg`,
and restart the game. The log I set will also show the ID conflicts.

By the time I updated to 2.7.3, community mods below I have tested and made compatible with Nyx:
